Instructions:
Our code, located in the "code" folder, can be compiled by running "make" in
Terminal while in the directory. The included Makefile provides the specific
details for compiling.

Running Instructions:
Our code can be executed in Terminal by entering ./Main.native followed by a
combination of the two letters "c" and "h" (without quotes). This determines
whether a player is the computer or human, and the order in which players go.
For example, ./Main.native ch would initialize a computer versus human game
where the computer is Player 1. Likewise, ./Main.native hh would initialize
a human versus human game where two different humans are Players 1 and 2.
